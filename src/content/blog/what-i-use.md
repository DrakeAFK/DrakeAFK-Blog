This will be a list of the tech and other things I use. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible. I will also have a section for things I have used in the past.  
I have no affiliate links or anything like that, so if I include a link to a product, it is just for reference and I am not making anything from it.

## What I Use

### <u>Computer</u>

#### Desktop

- Custom Built Gaming PC
  - This is my gaming rig. I have an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3060 TI (12GB VRAM Version), a 1TB NVMe SSD, a 1TB SATA SSD, and a 500GB SATA SSD. Windows 11 Pro is the primary OS installed on this machine since it is primarily used for gaming (yes I know you can game on Linux but I'm not trying to jump through unnecessary hurdles when I just want to get in a raid on Tarkov). However, I utilize the 500GB SATA SSD as a dual boot for Linux (I use Arch, btw). It is an absolute beast for gaming.

#### Laptop

- Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (Primary Work Computer)
  - While a few years old, this is my favorite computer for daily use and programming work. I've actually built this entire blog site and almost every other coding project in the past year on this computer. I have the AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 4650u CPU with integrated graphics, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 1920x1080p 14" built-in display. I have a stripped down version of Pop!_OS installed on it (sadly, not Arch, btw - but I need reliability for work and Pop!_OS just works - spare me the "Arch works *xyz blah blah*", I use Arch quite a lot on my desktop), and it runs great! I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a laptop for coding or daily use. There are certain tasks that require a bit more hardware, but for the most part, this is a great laptop. Plus, you can find them used for an absolute steal these days!

- Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (Gaming Away From Home)
  - This is my gaming laptop. I have the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, NVIDIA 3070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 2560x1600 16" built-in display. I have Windows 11 Pro installed on this machine (no dual boot to Linux for this computer as my ThinkPad is always with me). I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it or one of its successors to anyone wanting a gaming laptop. It is a bit heavy, battery life is terrible, but it is a gaming laptop, so that is to be expected. Plus, when I use it, it is always plugged in, so battery life is not an issue for me (I leave the GPU on all the time, so that is a huge drain on the battery if I were to use it unplugged).

- MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)
  - This laptop is rarely powered on these days, but I do occasionally use it. Primarily, I use it for testing various Linux distros. Right now it has Arch + Hyprland installed on it. The specs are quite low by todays standards, but it is still good for light coding and internet browsing (just don't open too many browser tabs or you'll feel the pain). These days the battery is shot so it has to remained plugged in while using it and I don't have a need to replace it yet.

### <u>Operating System</u>

- Micro$oft Windows 11 Pro
  - I use Microsoft Windows 11 Pro on my gaming desktop and gaming laptop.
- Arch Linux
  - I reserve the 1TB SATA SSD on my gaming desktop as a dual boot for Linux (I use Arch, btw). I use Arch on my gaming desktop for everything other than gaming and editing work.
- Pop!_OS
  - I use Pop!_OS on my ThinkPad. Pop!_OS is a great distro for my needs on that machine. It just works.

### <u>Peripherals</u>

#### Monitor

I use three monitors that my gaming desktop is always connected to. However, I also keep the primary monitor wired to a dock so that I can easily connect my ThinkPad when I want to work on a large display.

- Dell S2721DGF

  - This is my primary monitor. It is a 27", 1440p, 165Hz display with a 1ms response time. I use it with my gaming desktop and occasionally with my ThinkPad for working on a larger display. I have also done photo and video editing on this monitor and have found the colors to be quite accurate with minimal tweaking using the built-in settings (although I'm sure it could be better if I calibrated it). It is technically an HDR monitor, but it is not true HDR, so I don't really use it. Overall, a great monitor for gaming and general use. I also want to add that it has 4 USB ports that are very handy to have.

- ASUS VG248QG

  - I use two of these monitors as my secondary displays. They are 24", 1080p, 144hz (overclockable to 165Hz) display with a 1ms response time. These monitors only get used with my gaming desktop and are great for gaming and general use. I have not done any photo or video editing on these monitors, so I cannot speak to their color accuracy.

#### Mouse

- Logitech G502 LIGHTSPEED (Wireless)
  - My favorite gaming mouse that I have ever used. I used the wired version for > 4 years without any issues and finally upgraded to the wireless version.
- Logitech M720 Triathlon (Wireless)
  - Nothing truly special about this mouse. It works well and feels good in my hand. I use it with my ThinkPad when working at my desk. I may eventually upgrade to one of the Logitech MX Master series mice, but this one works well for now.

#### Keyboard

- CORSAIR K65 RGB MINI 60% Mechanical Keyboard with MX Speed Silver Switches
  - For gaming, I couldn't ask for more. The 60% form factor has a minimal footprint on my desk. The MX Speed Silver switches are great for gaming and typing, not super loud but "satisfying" and keystrokes take minimal force (may not be for everyone as it is very easy to actuate a key). The RGB lighting can easily be customized, I leave mine set to static dark red. The only downside is that it is not wireless, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
- Logitech ERGO K860 Split Keyboard (Wireless)
  - I really enjoy typing on this keyboard. I use it for hours when coding and have found it to be extremely comfortable given the split design and wrist rest. The keys are not mechanical, but they are very quiet and have a nice feel to them. It does take a little time to adjust to, for example with some split keyboards, the "B" key will be on the left and right side of the keyboard, but on this one, it is only on the right side.

#### Headset / Earbuds

- Logitech G PRO X (Wired)
  - I've used this headset for 2-3 years now and have had no issues with it. I've only used it on my gaming desktop, so I cannot speak to how well it works with other devices, but when I dual boot into Linux on that machine, it works great. The sound and microphone quality is quite good for a gaming headset and allows for some customization with the Logitech G Hub software. Sure, you can get much better with a dedicated microphone and audiophile headphones, but for gaming and general use, this headset ticks all the boxes for me. I may eventually move to a wireless headset or something with better sound quality, but this one works great for now.
- Sony MDR-EX15LP (Wired)
  - Cheap doesn't always mean bad. I use these earbuds with my ThinkPad and iPad when I want to listen to music or watch a video without disturbing others. They are cheap, but they work well and sound good for the price. No microphone, no volume controls, but comfortable for long periods of time. And if I lose them, I'm only out 10 bucks (I keep a few pairs laying around and in my backpack).
- Google Pixel Buds A Series (Wireless)
  - I use these often when I am out for a walk or working out. The sound quality is good when listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks. The microphone is okay for calls. Based on what others have said when on a call, they seem to pickup a fair amount of background noise (I have not tested this myself). The battery life is not fantastic, getting about 5 hours of listening time. However the case can charge them a number of times before it needs to be charged itself, and the case and the earbuds both charge rather quickly. I use them with my Google Pixel 7, iPad, ThinkPad, gaming laptop, and an iPhone 13 Pro Max and pairing is never a hassle. I will be upgrading to a version that has noise cancellation and a pair of over the ear headphones for use cases where I am not worried about portability.

#### Webcam

- Logitech C922 Pro Stream
  - Used for video calls and to make recordings where I want to show myself. It's 1080p but only 30fps, you need to go down to 720p to get 60fps. Controlling the picture is fairly easy with different Logitech software. I would prefer it to be able to swivel on the x axis, as its only adjustment is up and down. Other than that, I have no complaints. I have never used the built-in microphone so I cannot comment on the quality of it.

#### Printer

- Canon PIXMA TR4522
  - Pretty simple printer, scanner, and copier. I use it in my home office and it works well for my needs. Connecting to it wirelessly is a breeze and I have had no issues with it. Ink is reasonably priced compared to other printers.

#### Controllers

- PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller
  - I use this for some games that I play on PC. Sony has a program that allows you to update the controllers firmware without a PS5. There are also programs that allow you to tweak certain things, such as the adaptive triggers, lighting, etc. It can connect via Bluetooth or USB-C. I tend to use it over an Xbox controller because I prefer the way this feels in my hands.

- Xbox Wireless Controller
  - This is the standard controller for the Xbox Series X|S. I use it for some games that I play on PC if my PS5 controller doesn't want to cooperate (like when playing games from the Xbox app). It is Bluetooth so it could be used wirelessly, but it takes AA batteries so I just prefer to connect it via a USB-C cable.

#### Drawing Tablet

- Wacom Intuos M with Bluetooth
  - I like to use this tablet for writing notes and drawing diagrams. It does not have a built-in display, so you have to look at your computer screen while drawing or writing on the tablet. It does take a bit to get used to but it is not difficult to adjust. The M in the title denotes it is the medium sized tablet, which I find to be a good size for my needs, plus it does not take up too much space and can be stored anywhere. It can be connected via Bluetooth but I typically just plug it in with the included micro USB cable. The included pen seems to work quite well in terms of pressure sensitivity and comes with additional nibs (the tips that make contact with the tablet) that do not seem to wear down quickly. There are a few buttons on the pen that can be customized with the Wacom software as macros or different key presses. The tablet itself has a few buttons that can be customized as well. Overall, I have been very happy with this tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive drawing tablet.

### Mobile Devices

#### Phone

- Google Pixel 7
  - Don't be that person who silently judges me for preferring Android! I've used iPhones a lot but prefer the freedom to tweak and mess with things that Android allows (yeah it's not a Linux phone but I haven't found time to jump down that rabbit hole yet). The Android experience on this, or any other Pixel I've used, is great. There's not 1,001 extra apps installed (*cough*Samsung*cough*) and it's a very pleasing experience with a phone. You could turn it on, connect your Google account, and never have to touch anything and it would work great. Obviously I have tinkered with every possible setting on this device (btw, you should unlock the developer settings if you haven't, there's some nice little things that can boost performance and battery life). The camera is amaze-balls. I leave my camera settings on to shoot a JPEG + RAW image, but if I don't want to edit a RAW file (which I seldom do thanks to Google's image wizardry) there's a separate folder to easily delete the RAWs in bulk so they don't take up space (but also just get Google One with extra cloud storage for like 2 bucks a month, it's great for things other than just photos). The videos are great, 4K 60fps, and stabilization that is better than most gimbals I've used. The battery life is great, I often go two days or more without the bedside overnight charge (although I do typically always have it plugged in while in my vehicle even though wireless Android Auto is an option). The screen is great, 90Hz refresh rate, and the fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. I could go on and on about this phone, but I'll stop here. Actually, one last thing and maybe the most important to me, with this phone, I don't feel that need to upgrade to the *latest and greatest*. For what I use a phone for, which is more than an average user, it is fantastic (don't succumb to the evil marketing geniuses).

- iPhone 13 Pro Max
  - Okay, I know I just went on and on about the Pixel 7 being the greatest thing since sliced bread was invented so don't burn me at the stake. Even though I am a devout Android user, every few years I buy the latest and greatest iPhone to see what improvements have been made. And honestly, if I wasn't such a nerd, I'd be using this phone as my daily driver. But, I just can't get passed the Apple ecosystem. I know many people love it and cannot fathom escaping it, but it is just simply not for me. When I did daily drive the iPhone 13 Pro Max for a few weeks, I disabled everything I could that was Apple and used Google apps and services. It was an okay experience but too many hoops to jump through. Other than that, the phone itself is great. As I mentioned about my beloved Pop!_OS, it just works. But I can't help but think of it, or any other iPhone, as the phone you get grandma and grandpa when they finally have to transition to a smartphone and you want them to be able to use it without calling every thirty minutes.

#### Tablet

- iPad 10.2 inch (9th Gen)
  - Yeah yeah I just said I don't like Apple ecosystem etc etc. But hear me out. I don't use my tablet / iPad for any kind of productivity work. It sits on my desk or ventures to bed with me so I can watch things on it or have something playing in the background. That's literally the extent of my use for a tablet (at least for now, maybe due to it being the Apple ecosystem). For that, this is all I could need. I don't like having twenty different devices going off notifying me that Jack Mehoff has texted or called. I want those types of notifications on my phone and my phone only (seriously though, turn off the notifications for whatever is making your smartwatch go off every 10 seconds, that shit not good for you). Anyway, I won't discuss this product much because everyone knows what it is and what it does, and I don't use it a tenth of what it could do. I bought it from Best Buy during a sale for like 200 bucks and it fulfills its duties without any hiccups. Again, I use this for background and watching videos when I don't want to use a computer, that's it.
