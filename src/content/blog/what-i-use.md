This will be a list of the tech and other things I use. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible. I will also have a section for things I have used in the past.  
I have no affiliate links or anything like that, so if I include a link to a product, it is just for reference.

## What I Use

### Computers

#### Desktop

This is my gaming rig. I'm currently waiting for my GPU to arrive as this is a new build, but that is the final piece to the puzzle (I currently have my 3060TI installed). I have the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, 64GB DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA 4080 GPU, a 1TB NVMe SSD, a 4TB NVMe SSD, and a 1TB SATA SSD (for dual booting Linux). I have Windows 11 installed as the main OS as this is my main gaming machine, but utilize the 1TB SATA SSD as a dual boot for Linux (I use Arch, btw).

#### Laptops

##### Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 1

While a few years old, this is my favorite computer for daily use and programming. I have the AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 4650u CPU, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 1080p 14" display. I have a stripped down version of Pop!_OS installed on it, and it runs great! I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a laptop for programming or daily use. There are certain tasks that require a bit more hardware, but for the most part, this is a great laptop.

##### Lenovo Legion 5 Pro

This is my gaming laptop. I have the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, NVIDIA 3070 laptop GPU with 8GB GDDR6 memory and 140W TGP, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 2560x1600 16" display. As I want a smooth gaming experience with minimal hurdles, I have Windows 11 Pro installed on this machine. I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a gaming laptop. It is a bit heavy, battery life is terrible, but it is a gaming laptop, so that is to be expected. Plus, when I use it, it is always plugged in, so battery life is not an issue for me + I leave the GPU on all the time, so that is a huge drain on the battery if I were to use it unplugged.
