This will be a list of the tech and other things I use. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible. I will also have a section for things I have used in the past.  
I have no affiliate links or anything like that, so if I include a link to a product, it is just for reference and I am not making anything from it.

## What I Use

### <u>Computer</u>

#### Desktop

- Custom Built Gaming PC

  - This is my gaming rig. I have an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, 64GB DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3060 TI, a 1TB NVMe SSD, a 4TB NVMe SSD, and a 1TB SATA SSD. Windows 11 Pro is the primary OS installed on this machine since it is primarily used for gaming (yes I know you can game on Linux but I'm not trying to jump through unnecessary hurdles when I just want to get in a raid on Tarkov). However, I utilize the 1TB SATA SSD as a dual boot for Linux (I use Arch, btw). It is an absolute beast for gaming and works great for resource intensive tasks like video and photo editing as well as working with programs like Blender. I'm currently waiting for a new GPU to arrive (NVIDIA RTX 4080).

#### Laptop

- Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (Primary Work Computer)

  - While a few years old, this is my favorite computer for daily use and programming work. I've actually built this entire blog site and almost every other coding project in the past year on this computer. I have the AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 4650u CPU with integrated graphics, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 1920x1080p 14" built-in display. I have a stripped down version of Pop!_OS installed on it (sadly, not Arch, btw - but I need reliability for work and Pop!_OS just works - spare me the "Arch works *xyz blah blah*", I use Arch quite a lot on my desktop), and it runs great! I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a laptop for coding or daily use. There are certain tasks that require a bit more hardware, but for the most part, this is a great laptop. Plus, you can find them used for an absolute steal these days!

- Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (Gaming Away From Home)

  - This is my gaming laptop. I have the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, NVIDIA 3070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 2560x1600 16" built-in display. I have Windows 11 Pro installed on this machine (no dual boot to Linux for this computer as my ThinkPad is always with me). I have had no issues with it, and I would highly recommend it or one of its successors to anyone wanting a gaming laptop. It is a bit heavy, battery life is terrible, but it is a gaming laptop, so that is to be expected. Plus, when I use it, it is always plugged in, so battery life is not an issue for me (I leave the GPU on all the time, so that is a huge drain on the battery if I were to use it unplugged).

### <u>Operating System</u>

- Micro$oft Windows 11 Pro
  - I use Micro$oft Windows 11 Pro on my gaming desktop and gaming laptop.
- Arch Linux
  - I reserve the 1TB SATA SSD on my gaming desktop as a dual boot for Linux (I use Arch, btw). I use Arch on my gaming desktop for everything other than gaming and editing work.
- Pop!_OS
  - I use Pop!_OS on my ThinkPad. Pop!_OS is a great distro for my needs on that machine. It just works.

### <u>Peripherals</u>

#### Monitor

I use three monitors that my gaming desktop is always connected to. However, I also keep the primary monitor wired to a dock so that I can easily connect my ThinkPad when I want to work on a large display.

- Dell S2721DGF

  - This is my primary monitor. It is a 27", 1440p, 165Hz display with a 1ms response time. I use it with my gaming desktop and occasionally with my ThinkPad for working on a larger display. I have also done photo and video editing on this monitor and have found the colors to be quite accurate with minimal tweaking using the built-in settings (although I'm sure it could be better if I calibrated it). It is technically an HDR monitor, but it is not true HDR, so I don't really use it. Overall, a great monitor for gaming and general use.

- ASUS VG248QG

  - I use two of these monitors as my secondary displays. They are 24", 1080p, 144hz (overclockable to 165Hz) display with a 1ms response time. These monitors only get used with my gaming desktop and are great for gaming and general use. I have not done any photo or video editing on these monitors, so I cannot speak to their color accuracy.

#### Mouse

- Logitech G502 LIGHTSPEED (Wireless)
  - My favorite gaming mouse that I have ever used. I used the wired version for > 4 years without any issues and finally upgraded to the wireless version.
- Logitech M720 Triathlon (Wireless)
  - Nothing truly special about this mouse. It works well and feels good in my hand. I use it with my ThinkPad when working at my desk. I may eventually upgrade to one of the Logitech MX Master series mice, but this one works well for now.

#### Keyboard

- CORSAIR K65 RGB MINI 60% Mechanical Keyboard with MX Speed Silver Switches
  - For gaming, I couldn't ask for more. The 60% form factor has a minimal footprint on my desk. The MX Speed Silver switches are great for gaming and typing, not super loud but "satisfying" and keystrokes take minimal force (may not be for everyone as it is very easy to actuate a key). The RGB lighting can easily be customized, I leave mine set to static dark red. The only downside is that it is not wireless, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
- Logitech ERGO K860 Split Keyboard (Wireless)
  - I really enjoy typing on this keyboard. I use it for hours when coding and have found it to be extremely comfortable given the split design and wrist rest. The keys are not mechanical, but they are very quiet and have a nice feel to them. It does take a little time to adjust to, for example with some split keyboards, the "B" key will be on the left and right side of the keyboard, but on this one, it is only on the right side.

#### Headset / Earbuds

- Logitech G PRO X (Wired)
  - I've used this headset for 2-3 years now and have had no issues with it. I've only used it on my gaming desktop, so I cannot speak to how well it works with other devices, but when I dual boot into Linux on that machine, it works great. The sound and microphone quality is quite good for a gaming headset and allows for some customization with the Logitech G Hub software. Sure, you can get much better with a dedicated microphone and audiophile headphones, but for gaming and general use, this headset ticks all the boxes for me. I may eventually move to a wireless headset or something with better sound quality, but this one works great for now.
- Sony MDR-EX15LP (Wired)
  - Cheap doesn't always mean bad. I use these earbuds with my ThinkPad and iPad when I want to listen to music or watch a video without disturbing others. They are cheap, but they work well and sound good for the price. No microphone, no volume controls, but comfortable for long periods of time. And if I lose them, I'm only out 10 bucks (I keep a few pairs laying around and in my backpack).
- Google Pixel Buds A-Series (Wireless)
