This will be a list of the tech and other things I use. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible. I will also have a section for things I have used in the past.  
I have no affiliate links or anything like that, so if I include a link to a product, it is just for reference and I am not making anything from it.

#### Laptop

- Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (Primary Work Computer)

  - While a few years old, this is my favorite computer for daily use and programming work. I've actually built this entire blog site and almost every other coding project since late 2022 on this computer.
    - Specs:
      - CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 4650u (Integrated Graphics)
      - RAM: 32GB DDR4 3200MHz (16GB Soldered + 16GB Corsair Vengeance C22 SODIMM)

- Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (Gaming Away From Home)
  - This is my gaming laptop. It is a bit heavy, battery life is terrible, but it is a gaming laptop, so that is to be expected.

      - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H
      - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop

### <u>Peripherals</u>

#### Monitor

- My gaming desktop is connected to two monitors and my ThinkPad is connected to the primary monitor.

- 32" LG UltraGear (32GP83B-B.AUS) Nano IPS 1ms 165Hz QHD (2560 x 1440) Gaming Monitor
- 27" Dell (S2721DGF) QHD (2560 x 1440) 165Hz 1ms Gaming Monitor

#### Mouse

- Logitech G502 LIGHTSPEED (Wireless)
  - My favorite gaming mouse that I have ever used. I used the wired version for > 4 years without any issues and finally upgraded to the wireless version.
- Logitech M720 Triathlon (Wireless)
  - Nothing truly special about this mouse. It works well and feels good in my hand. I use it with my ThinkPad when working at my desk. I may eventually upgrade to the Logitech MX Master 3S, but this one works well for now.

#### Keyboard

- CORSAIR K65 RGB MINI 60% Mechanical Keyboard with MX Speed Silver Switches
  - For gaming, I couldn't ask for more. The 60% form factor has a minimal footprint on my desk. The MX Speed Silver switches are great for gaming, not super loud but "satisfying", and keystrokes take minimal force (may not be for everyone as it is very easy to actuate a key). The RGB lighting can easily be customized, I leave mine set to static dark red. The only downside is that it is not wireless, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
- Logitech ERGO K860 Split Keyboard (Wireless)
  - This is not a mechanical keyboard and is by no means a very "satisfying" typing experience, but it is extremely comfortable - and that is the reason I bought it. It does take a little time to adjust to, for example with some ergonomic/split keyboards, the "B" key will be on the left and right side of the keyboard, but on this one, it is only on the right side. After using this keyboard, I want to take the leep and purchase a proper mechanical split keyboard - I have really had my eye on the Kinesis Advantage2.
- Logitech MX Mechanical Mini (Wireless)
  - I really have mixed feelings about this keyboard. I purchased it on a whim one day in BestBuy because I wanted a smaller mechanical keyboard to use for programming that still had keys for 'Home', 'End', etc without having to hold the 'Fn' key like on my gaming keyboard. However, while it is a good keyboard and rather low-profile, it is not as comfortable as I would like. I've tried out multiple variations of wrist/palm rests but nothing seems to make it comfortable for long periods of time - Another nudge in the direction of the Kinesis Advantage2.

#### Headset / Earbuds

- Logitech G PRO X (Wired)
  - I've used this headset for a number of years now and it is still as solid as the day I bought it. While there's nothing super special about it (although you can customize the sound and microphone settings with Logitech's software), it is great for gaming and is comfortable to use for long periods of time - as someone with glasses and slightly larger than average ears, this is a big deal.
- Apple AirPods Max (Wireless)
  - My primary phone is a Pixel 7, and I don't own a Mac, so I understand the irony of owning these. They are very heavy compared to other headphones I have used, but the wizard engineers at Apple have managed to make these to be quite possible the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I've tried other noise-cancelling over-ear headphones (Sony XM5s, Bose QC lineup), but I've always found that their earcups are a little to small and not deep enough, leading to discomfort after a short period of time. That is not at all the case with these. I can truly wear these things for hours and hours. The sound quality, ANC, and everything about them are great. While my daily phone is an Android, I do own an iPhone 13 Pro Max and an iPad, so the inital configuration was a breeze. After that, pairing them with non-Apple devices was just as easy and any settings configured with Apple devices will remain unchanged on the non-Apple devices. But, if you don't own any Apple devices, I'm not sure I would recommend these as you would not be able to take advantage of the full feature set.
- Google Pixel Buds A Series (Wireless)
  - I use these often when I am out for a walk or working out. The sound quality is good when listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks. The microphone is okay for calls. Based on what others have said when on a call, they seem to pickup a fair amount of background noise (I have not tested this myself). These are my "active" earbuds and they leave me with no complaints, staying seated in my ears very well.
- Sony MDR-EX15LP (Wired)
  - I almost didn't even mention these. They are super cheap, basic earbuds. But, cheap doesn't always mean bad. I use these with my ThinkPad and iPad when I don't want to have something over my ears or on my head. They work well and sound good for the price. No microphone, no volume controls, but comfortable. And if I lose them, I'm only out 10 bucks (I always keep a few pairs laying around and in my backpack).

#### Webcam

- Logitech C922 Pro Stream
  - It's 1080p but only 30fps, you need to go down to 720p to get 60fps. Controlling the picture is fairly easy with different Logitech software or through OBS. I would prefer it to be able to swivel on the x axis, as its only adjustments are up and down. Other than that, I have no complaints. I have never used the built-in microphone so I cannot comment on the quality of it.

#### Controllers

- PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller
  - I use this for some games that I play on PC. Sony has an official program for Windows that allows you to update the controllers firmware without a PS5. There are also programs that allow you to tweak certain things, such as the adaptive triggers, lighting, etc. It can connect via Bluetooth or USB-C. I tend to use it over an Xbox controller when possible because I prefer the way this feels in my hands (it feels a bit larger and heavier, and overall a more "premium" feel).
- Xbox Wireless Controller
  - This is the standard controller for the Xbox Series X|S. I use it for some games that I play on PC if my PS5 controller doesn't want to cooperate (like when playing games from the Xbox app). It is Bluetooth so it could be used wirelessly, but it takes AA batteries so I just prefer to connect it via a USB-C cable.

#### Drawing Tablet

- Wacom Intuos M with Bluetooth
  - I like to use this tablet for writing notes, drawing diagrams, and sketching. It does not have a built-in display, so you have to look at your computer screen while drawing or writing on the tablet. It does take a bit to get used to but it is not difficult to adjust. The M in the title denotes it is the medium sized tablet, which I find to be a good size for my needs, plus it does not take up too much space and can be stored anywhere. It can be connected via Bluetooth but I typically just plug it in with the included micro USB cable. The included pen seems to work quite well in terms of pressure sensitivity and comes with additional nibs (the tips that make contact with the tablet) that do not seem to wear down quickly. There are a few buttons on the pen that can be customized with the Wacom software as macros or different key presses. The tablet itself has a few buttons that can be customized as well. Overall, I have been very happy with this tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive drawing tablet.

### Mobile Devices

#### Phone

- Google Pixel 7
  - This is my daily-driver phone. I've used iPhones in the past and it always felt like I was staying in a hotel, albeit a very nice hotel, but the Pixel just feels like home. I appreciate Android letting me use the phone more-or-less how I want to use it without many constraints. The Pixel 7 has never given me any issues, and I really like the "stock" Android experience since it is a phone from Google. There's a lot of nice to have features and the hardware, coupled with Google's software, make it a great phone. The camera is great for a smartphone. The battery life leaves me with no complaints - however, anytime I get a phone, I always dig through all of the settings and disable anything that I don't need, most of which are battery draining features.
- iPhone 13 Pro Max
  - Even though I am a very satisfied Android users, every few years I buy the latest and greatest iPhone to see what improvements have been made. And honestly, if I wasn't as happy with my Pixel as I am (or such a nerd for the things Android can let you do), I would happily be using this. The on-paper hardware specs are not anything super crazy, but everything about this phone just works, and works well. It's just hard for me to adopt the Apple ecosystem. I've tried to Android-ify iPhones in the past but it's just not the same. I know many people love it and cannot fathom escaping it, but it is just simply not for me. Other than that, the phone itself is great. As I mentioned about my beloved Pop!\_OS, it just works. But I can't help but think of it, or any other iPhone, as the phone you get grandma and grandpa when they finally have to transition to a smartphone and you want them to be able to use it without calling every thirty minutes.

#### Tablet

- iPad 10.2 inch (9th Gen)
  - Yeah yeah I just said I don't like Apple ecosystem etc etc. But hear me out. I don't use my iPad for any kind of productivity work. It sits on my desk while I'm working or ventures to bed with me so I can watch random YouTube videos or Twitch streams. That's the only thing I've every used this for. And for that, this iPad is all I could need. I won't dive into this iPad much because everyone knows what it is and what it does, and I don't use it for anything that would allow me to comment on its performance or features. Again, I use this for background noise and watching videos when I don't want to use my computer's resources or carry a laptop to bed. I may eventually try the Pixel tablet, but it would be used for the same purpose so it would be rather redundant.

### Accessories

- Monitor Arm
  - j5create Ergonomic Dual Monitor Desk Mount
    - This has been a great monitor arm. It feels very well-made and extremely secure when mounted to my desk. I'm sure there's better options out there, but I stumbled upon this at BestBuy the day I went to a 32" monitor - my previous monitor arm could only support up to 27" - and did not want to wait for something to be shipped. It has a very good range of motion. It also has built-in cable management, but I don't use them as I always prefer to just zip-tie my cables to the arms.
- Tablet Stand

  - Ikea Vivalla
    - Very simple and minimalistic. I actually use this to hold my drawing tablet when I'm not using it, as my iPad case has a built-in stand.

- USB Hub

  - Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub
    - I have a standing-desk - so I use this to connect my dongles and other peripherals that need to be on my desk and connected to my desktop. It makes it extremely easy to deal with potential cable length issues when adjusting the height of my desk (I don't keep my desktop on my desk, it is on a shelf next to my desk).

- Whiteboards - I have multiple, different sized whiteboards that I use for planning, brainstorming a coding project or problem, or just to use in place of post-it notes.

- Laptop Stand
  - Allsop Metal Art Adjustable Laptop Stand
    - This is by far the best laptop stand I have ever used. Very sturdy and a good amount of height adjustment. When I am working with only a laptop, I find that the max height position is perfect for me. It is also fairly portable, taking up about the same amount of space as a large three-ringed binder. While at home, I leave this below my primary monitor at the lowest height with my ThinkPad on it, lid closed. It makes for an excellent cable management solution as I can route all of my cables through the stand and out the back.

### Furniture

- Desks

  - 72" x 39" x 1.5" Allen + Roth Butcher Block
    - I purchased this from Lowe's and it is a solid piece of wood. I attached a standing desk frame and now have a very large, heavy-duty standing desk that will last for years for only a few hundred dollars. Being just a solid piece of wood, I've been able to drill holes on the under-side to mount various cable management solutions. After using a desk of this size, I don't think I could ever go back to a smaller desk. My desktop is on a shelf to the right of the desk, and I keep my monitors towards that side. This leaves me with a large amount of space on the left side of the desk for everyday items and writing in notebooks without feeling cluttered or having to move things around.
  - TOPSKY Dual Motor Electric Standing Desk Frame
    - This frame was purchased from Amazon and it has been great. If you're even the slightest bit patient, there are frequent sales for this model that put it anywhere between $200-250. It is very sturdy and has a good height range. Even with the ~41kg butcher block and everything else I have on my desk, there are no issues when raising or lowering. I read reviews of other standing desk frames where people mention how bad their desk will wobble when at a standing position, I do not have that issue with this frame. One of the primary reasons I chose this frame over alternatives is because of the way the support arms at the sides of the desk align with the crossbar. Many standing desk frames will have the support arms slightly higher than the crossbar. With this frame, the crossbar is the same height as the support arms on the sides, which will prevent my desk from sagging in the middle over time. I keep my desk at a standing position for the majority of the day, only sitting when I'm playing a game or watching a video.

- Chairs
  - Large Exercise Ball
    - There's a lot of debate whether it is "good" to sit on an exercise ball while working at your desk. I find it to be quite enjoyable. I feel like it actually pushes me to sit straighter and keep my core engaged. I find it is a good mix with the standing desk, as I feel it keeps me in more of an active state while working.
