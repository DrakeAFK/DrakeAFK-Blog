This post will be a brief introduction to the DrakeAFK blog detailing who I am, what I do, why I made this blog, and what you can expect to find here.  
I will try to keep it short and sweet, but I am not known for my brevity.

## Who am I?

My name is Drake, but I go by DrakeAFK online. If you are not up to date with internet slang, AFK stands for "Away From Keyboard". It's sort of a joke, albeit a bad one, to use AFK as a suffix to my name because I am a programmer and spend a lot of time at my keyboard.
